In the ASP.NET Fundamentals course, we learn important principles built into ASP.NET Core. We are introduced to the basic principles of web development, such as HTTP protocols and sessions. We write a generic MVC framework with support for all the core features needed for a modern web application. We learn to build our own web application with C# and relational databases using MS SQL Server with separation of models, views and controllers for these purposes.
